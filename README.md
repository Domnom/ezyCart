# Welcome!

ezyCart is a programming test for ezyVet. It allows a user to:
- View products
- Add products to their cart
- View their cart
- Remove products from their cart


## [Check me out now](https://ezycart.vercel.app/)



# Whats going on?
ezyCart is built with React + Redux and features a bunch of goodies to assist in the development process:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
|React | Javascript UI |
|Redux | Handle state |
|Storybook | Isolate components and promote CDD|
|Sass| Styling|
|Jest| Unit tests, TDD|
|Cypress| E2E tests|
|React-testing-library| A better way to TDD. Used in both unit and E2E tests to maintain consistent UI search/queries|
|Github actions| CICD for ezyCart|
|Vercel|Deploys the app to the web|
